  This document contains the instructions for preparing a paper submitted
  to COLING-2020 or accepted for publication in its proceedings. The document itself
  conforms to its own specifications, and is therefore an example of
  what your manuscript should look like. These instructions should be
  used for both papers submitted for review and for final versions of
  accepted papers. Authors are asked to conform to all the directions
  reported in this document.

\section{Introduction}
Here is something regarding semanitc change \cite{schlechtweg2018diachronic}

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Diachronic Lexical Semantic Change}
With an increasing interest in Diachronic Lexical Semantic Change (LSC)  
there is a multitude of approaches. 
Three different word representations are commonly used. 
First are semantic vector representations such as word2vec \cite{mikolov2013efficient},
which represents each word with two different vectors for each time period respectively \cite{hamilton2016cultural,hamilton2016diachronic}.
The vectors itself represent the co-occurence statistics of the word in the given time period.
\cite{frermann2016bayesian} use 
bayesian learning
